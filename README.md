## Introduction:
This is project consists of 3 distinct but interlinked components leadaing to a complete Quarantine Management System  
1. **Quarantine Management Application (QMA)**  
The QMA is intended to be installed on Quarantined Individual's mobile phones. The application records user data such as Temperature, Location, Face, etc. on a regular basis to ensure that the user is safely quarantined at home. 
2. **Effort Management Application (EMA)**  
The EMA is a complete management system for quarantined citizens. It consists of a web dashboard and mobile application.
The online dashboard is used to get an overview of all the users currently using the QMA and CMA.
It allows officers to view data related to all the users along with any alerts raised by these users.
The EMA mobile application is intended to be used by field officers. Using this application, new quarantined individuals can easily be added.
The mobile application also allows for easy alert addressing and checklist additions of quarantined individuals. 
3. **Citizen Management Application (CMA)**  
The CMA is a mobile applccation to be downloaded by regular citizens. Using this application, they can recieve easy alerts from government officials regarding
safety precautions and notifications. Users are also shown a map of prior cases and regions of high people concentration to avoid.
If a citizen is feeling symptoms or has come in contact with a positive tested patient, they can request a checkup directly from the application.
